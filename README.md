## BACKGROUND
Due to the smaller scale and limited mortgage assets of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, banks typically provide loans based on credit policies, transaction history, and
the influence of upstream and downstream entities. They may offer interest rate concessions to
enterprises with high reputation and low credit risk. Banks evaluate credit risk, considering
financial strength and reputation, before determining lending decisions and credit terms.

This project is mainly completed by SPSS and MATLAB.

The detailed description of the project is in the pdf file entitled "SME-Credit-Decision".
